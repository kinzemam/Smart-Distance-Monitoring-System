## Smart Distance Monitoring & Alert System

This project measures real-time object distance using an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) and displays it on a 16x2 LCD. 
If the object is closer than 10 cm, an LED blinks as an alert.

### Components:
- Arduino UNO
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- LED and Resistor
